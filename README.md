- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @CrispysCoding
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in Everything programing and Engineering 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning The 3 C's (C#,C++,C) and Sql

Im looking for someone to program with, and just to become a better programmer. I like to have a second pov on my code rather than having someone who know absoulutely nothing about
what I am doing. Overall just making friends along the way. Im not good now, but hopefully I can just have a career in programming.
